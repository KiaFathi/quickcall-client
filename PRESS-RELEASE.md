##About:
QuickCall is the first mobile app on the Firefox Marketplace that allows internet based voice-calling (VoIP) for the Firefox Operating System.

Making international calls is expensive and not covered in many phone plans. Amongst the solutions to this problem are Skype and other softphone service providers. These current solutions can be large and memory intensive applications, use a lot of phone battery, and occasionally slow and inconsistent. Additionally, adoption of these softphone services requires a sign-up and the exchange of usernames, adding an additional barrier to use.

QuickCall provides an affordable and accessible solution. QuickCall uses a cheap, pay as you go system to enable your phone to call other phone-numbers using Voice over IP. Just enter a phone number and QuickCall will connect you.

“This app does one thing and one thing beautifully well, VoIP calling for Firefox OS”
-DH Lee, QuickCall Project Lead. 

User just need to have the app and the phone number they want to call. Its that easy.

“I travel across the globe constantly. QuickCall enables me to stay in touch with my friends/family/business associates without a SIM card or Foreign Data Plan.” -Joe the Plumber, QuickCall adopter.
